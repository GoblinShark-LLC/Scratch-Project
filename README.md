##Description
Ever wanted to know the best resource to learn a certain language? Well, now you can! Enter DevShark: a centralized collection of resources shared and approved by the developer community.

##Iteration Ideas
1. Add user authentication so individual likes and dislikes can be saved to their profile. 
2. Comments for each post
3. Modals for each resource that gives you more information about the resource(i.e. icons, pictures, tags, all-time favorites, etc.)
4. More robust error handling for resource submission (i.e. no duplicate article, URL formatting, etc. )
5. Home page 
6. BONUS: Re-factor in Rust on the backend and Typescript on the front-end
7. BONUS: Utilize Deno over Node
